# MortgageCustomerSegmentation
This repository contains the code with solution for capstone project done on customer segmentation for mortgage company. This is a part of Springboard DS career track course.
Executive Summary
==================
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify understand customer needs. 

The top three lenders have a total share of $150 million, with the leader having a share of $80 million. Rest of the pie is distributed amongst 400 small and medium-sized lenders.
According to the problem defined by top players, the mortgage companies have not been able to understand their target customers and provide suitable loan products.

As per a recent study conducted by J.D. Powers, 63% of customers would leave their mortgage servicer for better customer service. The same study shows that 27% of first-time buyers and 21% of all borrowers regret their choice of lender.
Mortgage companies want to increase their market share and for doing so they need to understand their customers better. This project aims to use data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and build an unsupervised machine learning model to segment their customer base.   

The problem in this project to be addressed is that <u>“Is it possible to identify the segment of mortgage customer based on the loans provided to the customer in the last three years?” </u>
